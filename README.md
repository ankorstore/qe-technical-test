# Ankorstore Quality Engineering technical test

## What is this
This test aims to evaluate automation and technical levels from candidates. You've been given a script written by a junior automation engineer.
His task was to automate two simple scenarios:
 * go to https://demoblaze.com, login with the given credentials, open the first product page in the list and check the name of the product is correct
 * go to https://demoblaze.com, add the first product to your cart, then check you correctly have one product in the cart

He hands you his first version: [index.js](index.js). You launch it and it pass ! Everything is green :heavy_check_mark: !

You then take a took at the code. Oops, there's room for improvement... what kind of improvement can you suggest to your colleague ?

:warning: All remarks are valid, from code issue to automation-related issues and weird design choices.
